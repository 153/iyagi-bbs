It works via a flatfile database and already has many features
from textboards such as Shiichan and Kareha implemented.

and modify or use their copy of the script to their own ends.
However, post here at your discretion, and consider whatever
you post to be possibly subject to deletion. You can browse

[here](//github.com/153/iyagi-bbs).
