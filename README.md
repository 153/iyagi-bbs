# wbs
Python web board system (textboard, CGI, flatfile)

Inspired by [Kareha](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/web/wakaba_kareha), 
[Shiichan](https://wakaba.c3.cx/shii/shiichan), [Tablecat BBS](http://tablecat.ipyo.heliohost.org/bbs/), 
and others. 

The script is still in a very early beta, but it currently supports the following features:
- Thread posting
- Thread indexing
- Thread replying with/without bumps
- Tripcodes

Here's what I'd like to add to bring it to v1.0:
- Themes / Themepicker
- Stickied threads, locked threads, non-bumpable threads
- Linking to other replies in a thread by typing >>1, >>5, etc
- A proper thread index for the main page
- Some kind of markup format - probably markdown derived
- Admin panel, IP logging, anti-spam filters
- RSS list of threads

Possible bonus features:
- Youtube / Soundcloud embed
- Twitter login as an alternative to tripcodes for identifying posts
